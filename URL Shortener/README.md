 # YAML URL Shortener
 This is a program that allows for local host URL access. Instead of typing in a full URL with a .com, .edu, etc.  domain, you can simply access the desired domain through `localhost:8080/path`, where "path" is specified by the user in the separate YAML file. For example, you can access the url "https://ipdusa.com", with the path "ipd" that is associated with it (see the YAML file for implementation). This can be observed by typing `localhost:8080/ipd` in your browser search bar. This program also uses a flag "`-file`".   
 `-file` : This flag sets an argument that specifies the name of your YAML file which contains your desired URL's and paths associated with them. This flag defaults to "paths.yaml". This file is encouraged to be modified, and if renamed, be sure to include `-file = "yourfilename.yaml"` when executing `go run main.go`.
